              <p>
                I am a Computer Science and Mathematics student at Schreyer Honors College, Penn State University, specializing in artificial intelligence and machine learning. With a 3.98/4.00 GPA, I have consistently been recognized on the Dean's List for academic excellence.
              </p>
              <p>
                My academic journey includes a summer at Stanford University, where I explored advanced AI and machine learning concepts, gaining hands-on experience in algorithm development and real-world applications.
              </p>
              <p>
                Through research positions and internships, I have contributed to AI-driven projects ranging from adaptive learning algorithms to real-time image processing systems using YOLOv5 and OpenCV. My experience bridges theoretical research with practical implementation, driving innovation in AI applications.
